This Agreement is a legal document between You and MadeByPavich, governing your use of the Application.

This Agreement is solely between You and MadeByPavich and not with the Application Store. MadeByPavich is responsible for the Application and its content. The Application Store is a third-party beneficiary with the right to enforce this Agreement regarding your use of the Application.

## License
### Scope of License
MadeByPavich grants You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the Application strictly in accordance with this Agreement. You may only use the Application on a Device that You own or control, as permitted by the Application Store's terms and conditions. This license is for your personal, non-commercial use.

## Maintenance and Support
MadeByPavich does not provide maintenance or support for the Application. To the extent required by applicable law, MadeByPavich shall furnish any necessary maintenance or support, not the Application Store.

## Third-Party Services
The Application may display or link to third-party content or services. You acknowledge that MadeByPavich is not responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their accuracy, completeness, legality, or quality. You access these services at your own risk and must comply with their terms.

## Term and Termination
This Agreement remains in effect until terminated by either You or MadeByPavich. MadeByPavich may suspend or terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without prior notice. If You fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement, it will terminate immediately without notice.

You may terminate this Agreement by deleting the Application and all copies from your Device. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Application and delete all copies from your Device.

Termination does not limit MadeByPavich's rights or remedies for any breach by You.

## No Warranties
The Application is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without any warranties. To the fullest extent permitted by law, MadeByPavich disclaims all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. MadeByPavich does not guarantee that the Application will meet your requirements or operate without errors.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty exclusions, so some of the above may not apply to You.

## Entire Agreement
